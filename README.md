## Me

Hi my name is Alex Clarke!

I'm a PhD candidate in the Department of Bioengineering at Imperial College London, supervised by Professor Dario Farina. I am taking a break at the moment to do in internship at Meta Reality Labs NYC in a computational modelling team. 

My research looks at methods of separating neurophysiological signals such as electromyography and intercortical recordings into their constituent sources, for which I use an unholy blend of traditional digital signal processing methods and contemporary machine learning techniques. 

Before my PhD I was a doctor in the NHS, trying to do as many brain-related things as I could! During the covid pandemic I ended up taking a PhD pause to go work at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, Queen Square. 

## Github  Projects

I am currently working on an easy to use GPU-accelerated decomposition platform for surface and intramuscular EMG called SESSIONS.

I'm also in the process of consolidating my PhD ML code into a nice repository (partly due to guilt after comparing my spaghetti code to the pristine code I see every day in my internship...)
